% CS4300_driver_proj - driver for Kalman Filter projectile tracking
% This script demonstrates the use of the kalman filter in projectile
% tracking.
%
% A simple model for a 2D projectile is obtained and used for the
% kalman
% filter transition model. The actual trajectory of the projectile is
% simulated using a more complex and accurate model. Observations of
% the
% actual projectile trajectory are obtained. The kalman filter is used
% to
% generate beliefs on the actual projectile state. All three
% trajectories
% (the simple model, the complex model, and the kalman belief) are
% plotted,
% along with the observations made.
% On input:
%     dt (float): simulation time step in seconds (e.g., 0.1)
%     t_max (float): max simulation time in seconds (e.g., 35)
%     obs_freq (float): frequency with which time steps are observed,
%        range [0,1] (e.g., .35)
%     g (float): gravitational acceleration in m/sˆ2 (9.8)
%     r (float): transition noise; (e.g., 2)
%           increase for faster response to observations
%     q (float):observation noise; increase for greater
%           observation spread (e.g., 10)
% On output:
%     xt (nx4 array): trace of estimated pose
%     at (nx4 array): trace of actual pose
%     zt (mx2 array): trace of sensor data
%     St (struct array): covariance matrix trace
%       (i).Sigma2 (4x4 array): estimated vector covariance
% Call:
%     [xt,at,zt,St] = CS4300_driver_proj(0.1,35,0.35,9.8,2,10);
